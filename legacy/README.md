# Legacy Snapshot

`legacy/engine-v2/` is a frozen archaeology snapshot from the pre-workspace codebase.

It is kept only for historical reference and debugging context.
It is not part of the active Cargo workspace, not used by CI, and should not be extended for new features.

All active development lives under the workspace root (`crates/`, `rave-cli/`, `src/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`).
